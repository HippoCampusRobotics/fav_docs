Installation and Setup
######################

.. note::
   The target platform of :file:`ros-humble` and :file:`ros-iron` is Ubuntu 22.04.
   Hence, in the following sections, Ubuntu 22.04 will be assumed as used operating system.
   You can download the desktop image from the `official webiste <https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/>`_.
   Other operating systems might work as well and you can try to use them if you feel confident to do so.
   However, we cannot help you if you encounter any problems.
   If you do not want to install Ubuntu natively on your computer, you can use a Virtual Machine (but we still definitely recommend using a native Ubuntu installation).
