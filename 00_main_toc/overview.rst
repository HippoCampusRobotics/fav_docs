Class Overview
==============

General Information
###################


In this class, we explore the exciting field of **mobile robotics using the example of underwater robots**. However, everything you will learn in this class will be transferable to any other kind of mobile robot! 

During the class, we will get in touch with the whole robotics pipeline, starting from **sensing** over **perception**, to **planning**, and **control and actuation**. An important focus will lie on gaining **hands-on robotics experience** using real underwater robots in simulation and experiment.
You will learn about state-of-the-art robotic tools such as ROS2/Gazebo and their usage for simulation and experiments.

Our class is based on the challenge-based-learning concept. This means you will explore the challenges in mobile robotics on your own during **several guided assignments** and a **final group project**.

.. todo:: Following paragraph needs to be adapted to bachelor class

While the first half of the term will consist of **keynote lectures** and **assignments**, the second half of the term is dedicated to the final group projects, where you will be given a challenge to solve. The lectures are supposed to give you some ideas and starting points.
Finally, you will develop and propose solution concepts based on the topics covered.

Format and Schedule
###################

.. todo:: verify this is still correct. Still hybrid? Still this schedule?

The class will be held in a hybrid format including Zoom and in-person pitch lectures as well as practical lab experiments.
Pitch lectures in the first half of the course will be held on Fridays from 11:30 to 13:00.


Registration
############

Students who are interested in participating in this class register via StudIP (TUHH-Students). TODO Link.

.. note::

    Unfortunately, we have to limit the number of spots in this class. In case the number of registered students exceeds our capacity, we will go through a selection.
