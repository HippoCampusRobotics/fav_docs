The Robot
#########

The underwater vehicle we use in class is called BlueROV2 and made by the company `Blue Robotics <https://bluerobotics.com/>`_. The BlueROV2 is one of the most popular commercial underwater drones. 

ROV stands for **Remotely Operated (Underwater) Vehicle**. The BlueROV2 has a tether attached to it, making it possible to control it remotely. However, it can also operate autonomously.

Our BlueROV2 has been upgraded to the so-called `Heavy Configuration <https://bluerobotics.com/introducing-bluerov2-heavy/>`_. In this configuration, the BlueROV2 has two additional vertical thrusters, providing six degree-of-freedom control.
