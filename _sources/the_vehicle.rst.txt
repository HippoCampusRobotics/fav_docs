The Vehicle
###########

The underwater vehicle we use in class is called BlueROV2. It has eight thrusters, mounted in a way that allows to actuate all six degrees of freedom (3 translatory and 3 rotational). You can visit the `Blue Robotics website <https://bluerobotics.com/store/rov/bluerov2/>`_ to get a detailed description of the vehicle.

Four of the eight thrusters have their axis in parallel to the horizontal plane. The other four are in parallel to the vehicle's z-axis.
