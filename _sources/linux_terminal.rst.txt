Linux Terminal
##############

For those of you not quite that familiar with Linux and/or the terminal and the command line, this section will give you some useful hints.

In many cases it will be necessary/convenient to have multiple terminal sessions. So its recommendable to install :code:`terminator`, to have multiple terminals multiplexed in a single window. Install it with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt install terminator

Cook Delicious Copy-Pasta
=========================

Of course you can copy&paste in terminals via keyboard shortcuts. But you will additionally need to use the :kbd:`Shift` key.

copy
   :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`C`

paste
   :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`B`
