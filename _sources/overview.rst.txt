Class Overview
==============

.. attention::

    We will host **a preliminary info session** in-person on Tuesday, Oct 12th, at 16:15 in M 0571 and via Zoom. We are looking forward to meeting you! :)

General Information
###################


In this class, we explore the exciting field of **mobile robotics using the example of underwater robots**. However, everything you will learn in this class will be transferable to any other kind of mobile robot! 

During the class, we will get in touch with the whole robotics pipeline, starting from **sensing** over **perception**, to **planning**, and **control and actuation**. An important focus will lie on gaining **hands-on robotics experience** using real underwater robots in simulation and experiment.
You will learn about state-of-the-art robotic tools such as ROS/Gazebo and their usage for simulation and experiments.

Our class is based on the challenge-based-learning concept. This means you will explore the challenges in mobile robotics on your own during **several guided assignments** and a **final group project**.

While the first half of the term will consist of **keynote lectures** and **assignments**, the second half of the term is dedicated to the final group projects. In these projects, your group will identify interesting robotics problems of your own choice (e.g. pollution monitoring in harbors) and investigate the related theory and challenges. The lectures are supposed to give you some ideas and starting points.
Finally, you will develop and propose solution concepts based on the topics covered.

Format and Schedule
###################

The class will be held in a hybrid format including Zoom and in-person pitch lectures as well as practical lab experiments.
Pitch lectures in the first half of the course will be held on Tuesday afternoons at 16:15 until approximately 18:15.

**Schedule TBA**. 

Registration
############

Students who are interested in participating in this class register via StudIP (TUHH-Students). 

.. note::

    Unfortunately, we have to limit the number of spots in this class. In case the number of registered students exceeds our capacity, we will go through a selection. The final acceptance will be sent out w/c Oct 25th.
