.. note::
   ROS Melodic's target platform is Ubuntu 18.04. Hence in the following sections, Ubuntu 18.04 will be assumed as used operating system. You can download the desktop image from the `official webiste <https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/>`_. Other operating system might work as well and you can try to use them if you feel confident to do so. However, we cannot help you if you encounter any problems. If you do not want to install Ubuntu natively on your computer, you can use a Virtual Machine (but we still recommend using a native Ubuntu installation).
