IDE Setup
#########

For this class we recommend Visual Studio Code. Of course you can use any IDE you like and that works for you. The `ROS Wiki <http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs>`_ lists several options how to use IDEs with ROS.

Installation
============

Ubuntu has :code:`snap` preinstalled so probably the easiest way to install VS Code is to execute

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo snap install --classic code-insiders

For more detailed instructions and alternative installation options see the `VS Code Documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux>`_.
